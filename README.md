# Extra credit
## Justification for YouTube videos:
People visit my portfolio to learn more about me. Embedding two youtube videos of my FPV quadcopter videos helps them learn more about my hobbies, and providing these as video in the site (as opposed to links) helps create a seamless, aesthetic experience for the user

## Instagram post
Please click on the bold header text that says "FPV Quadcopter Videos" to view the instagram post. I decided not to include it in the default site view because it looks a bit out of place, and didn't line up with the aesthetic I was going for. However, this does help the user learn more about me and my hobbies (hiking), so I may include it in the future. I hope this counts as extra credit because I fully implemented it (you just have to click to view it as a hidden feature), I just decided not to include it.
